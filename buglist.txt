You can find all appearing bugs that need to be fixed here:
    - clicking "Restart Game" should change the players image - but just a black rectangle appears
    - highscore isn't written correctly in .txt


    SOLVED:
    - every time you click on "Restart Game" the obstacles aren't moving anymore
